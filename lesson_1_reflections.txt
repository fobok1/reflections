How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It's easier to see where the error was as you only have to look through the lines that had changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
The same way as having earlier versions of a document may help, you can go back and find code that worked before to fix errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The pro is simple, having control lets you commit when it makes sense and only when it makes sense, and it's easy to describe the changes.
The cons are that you may forget, or commit too often. Either way would be confusing.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Find the git commit ids in git log, and then compare with git diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Safety net. You can always go back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I might have to give this a try with my story editing! If git works with non-text-files.
