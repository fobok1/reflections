When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
All the time. Local files aren't safe, but also there may be need to work on files from multiple locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case of changes you made that are not on the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones done on GitHub, giving credit. Clones copy repositories, and branches are new branches of the history tree.
